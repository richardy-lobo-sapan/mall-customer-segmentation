# mall-customer-segmentation
This is a data science project involving Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, and Clustering. The dataset source is from kaggle and this project is made solely for learning purposes

CONTEXT
This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

CONTENT
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.


This project can answer rhis question below.
1- How to achieve customer segmentation using machine learning algorithm (KMeans Clustering) in Python in simplest way.
2- Who are your target customers with whom you can start marketing strategy [easy to converse]
